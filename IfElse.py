# this print ("its for 1st if") does not belongs to if block . We follow here indentation.
# What is indentation ? : It is some specific spaces one,two, three..

x=8
r=x%2
if r==0:
    print("even")
print("odd")
# if value of x is even then it will print even  and it will print also odd Bcz its out of indentation.
# or value of x is not even then it will print odd.
#  for that we have to put condition for printing a msg odd.
# Correct ans is given below
print
xx=8
